# DNA_Encoding_Operation
This Matlab code is used for performing DNA Encoding Operations -Rule 01 to 08

Note: If you are using my code for your system or project, you should always cite my paper as a reference.

This matlab code contains all 8 DNA encoding operations (Watson-Crick base pairing). You can chose which rule is used for encoding. The output is a string matrix , you can see on workspace.

Functions:

Main function      : main.m
Rule 01            : DNA_encoding_rule01.m
Rule 02            : DNA_encoding_rule02.m
Rule 03            : DNA_encoding_rule03.m
Rule 04            : DNA_encoding_rule04.m
Rule 05            : DNA_encoding_rule05.m
Rule 06            : DNA_encoding_rule06.m
Rule 07            : DNA_encoding_rule07.m
Rule 08            : DNA_encoding_rule08.m
