This matlab code contains all 8 DNA encoding operations (Watson-Crick base pairing). You can chose which rule is used for encoding. The output is a string matrix , you can see on workspace.

    Functions:

    Main function      : main.m
    Rule 01            : DNA_encoding_rule01.m
    Rule 02            : DNA_encoding_rule02.m
    Rule 03            : DNA_encoding_rule03.m
    Rule 04            : DNA_encoding_rule04.m
    Rule 05            : DNA_encoding_rule05.m
    Rule 06            : DNA_encoding_rule06.m
    Rule 07            : DNA_encoding_rule07.m
    Rule 08            : DNA_encoding_rule08.m
